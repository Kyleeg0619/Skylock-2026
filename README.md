# Skylock-2026 | A cozy idle‑management game that helps players focus in real life

SkyLock is a 2D browser‑based gamified focus tool where players act as angelic farmers tending to islands with animals. Players collect, upgrade, and care for these angels while balancing a unique productivity mechanic that rewards real‑world focus.

# **Core Gameplay Loop**

**Collect Angelic Animals**


Each angel is a heavenly version of a real‑world animal (e.g., Angel Cow, Angel Fox, Angel Frog). 


Angels generate passive coins over time.


Rarer angels have special buffs (e.g., x2 coins, boosted short‑task rewards)


**Manage Floating Islands**


Each island houses two angels. 


Players can purchase new islands to expand their farm.


Both angels and islands can be upgraded to Level 3, increasing passive coin generation.


**Excursions - *Productivity Mechanic***


Players send angels on timed “excursions” that lock the player out of gameplay.


While locked out, angels earn significantly more coins.


The game keeps track of the browser tabs


Social Media cannot be accessed during excursion time


Cancelling early yields only the passive rate, reinforcing commitment to real‑world tasks like studying or homework.


This blends idle gaming with focus‑timer psychology.


**Gacha System**
Players spend coins to roll for new angels.


Rarity tiers influence:


Coin multipliers


Excursion efficiency


Special buffs for short or long tasks


**Daily Return System**


If the player hasn’t logged in for 24 hours, their angels appear in “hell.”


Players must pet them to bring them back to their islands.


This creates a gentle, humorous nudge to return daily.
